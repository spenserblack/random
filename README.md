# Random Response

Get a random value from an HTTP request.

The purpose of this is to get a random value when you cannot use
"code" in the traditional sense. For example, if you wanted to create
a dynamic badge to be displayed in Markdown, without using a scheduled action
and/or committing changes to the badge URL.
